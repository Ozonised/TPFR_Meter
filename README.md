# TPFR_Meter
This is an ATmega328p based Temperature, PWM generator, Frequency and RPM meter. 
Often when creating circuits involving MOSFETs or motor drivers, I happen to find a need for a temperature sensor to measure the temperatures of my MOSFETs or a PWM generator to control the speed of motors or test servos. Not only did have a need for a PWM generator but also a frequency counter when tinkering around with ne555 cicuits based oscillator circuits. Designing separate circuits to fullfill each of needs would prove to time consuming, expensive and and space to store all the devices. Thus, the idea of creating all purpose meter to serve all my needs struck me which resulted in me creating this multi purpose meter.

# FEATURES: 
## 1. TEMPERATURE
The temperature measurement is done with the help of a ds18b20 waterproof temperature sensor with a max measurable temperature of 125 degree celsius.

## 2. PWM
